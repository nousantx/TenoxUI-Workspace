# Design Workspace 🗿

## About

Doesn't have spec for editing? let's use code to make some design instead. 🗿 🗿 🗿

## Stack

- ReactJS (vite)
- Typescript
- TenoxUI for styles 😎

## Feature 🗿

- In styling part :

  - Using classname for styles (utility-first css) with tenoxui
  - No generated css file.
  - Almost real time (i swear)
  - Easy to customize, adding re-usable styles, state styles, and more.
  - (flexing tenoxui 😎)

- html2canvas for converting the design
- Ready defined class name and components

## More

- Edit `src/desgn/index.tsx` for the design
- Slug `/workspace` to download the image

Note: Not for production 🗿 (for what?)

_(this is the real purpose of why tenoxui was created 🗿)_
